## 👋🏽 About me

I spend most of my time working with low-level C code and reverse engineering stuff.  
There's something satisfying about understanding exactly how programs work at the binary level.  
Also do some game development when I have time.

### What I use

**C** – My go-to for fast, low-level tasks or direct system interaction  
**C#** – Good for building desktop apps and services  
**Java** – Mostly for work projects and anything that needs to run everywhere  
**Python** – Quick scripts, automation, data processing  
**Node.js** – Backend APIs and build tools  
**Databases** – SQL Server, PostgreSQL, some MongoDB when needed  
**Ghidra** – For reverse engineering and malware analysis  
**Game dev** – Godot, some OpenGL stuff in C
