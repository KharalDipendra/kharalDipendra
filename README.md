## About me

I spend most of my time working with low-level C code and reverse engineering stuff. There's something satisfying about understanding exactly how programs work at the binary level. Also do some game development when I have time.

### What I use

**C** - My go-to for anything that needs to be fast or interact directly with the system

**C#** - Good for building desktop apps and services

**Java** - Mostly for work projects and anything that needs to run everywhere  

**Python** - Quick scripts, automation, data processing

**Node.js** - Backend APIs and build tools

**Databases** - SQL Server, PostgreSQL, some MongoDB when needed

**Ghidra** - For reverse engineering and malware analysis

**Game dev** - Godot, some OpenGL stuff in C

### Currently working on

Reverse engineering Pokemon Fire Red to extract assets and recreate the maps in Tiled with .tsx and .tmx files for my game since I suck at map design. Also working on a Site for my Uni clu
I like figuring out why things break and making them faster.
